#  Statistical Analysis Selection 

+ **What are your research hypotheses / questions?**
	+ **Difference?**
		+ **Experimental, Quasi-experimental, or Comparative**
		+ **Difference inferential statistics**
	+ **Association?**
		+ **Association (relation) between 2 or more variables**
		+ **Associational inferential statistics**
	+ **Descriptive?**

#  Statistical Analysis Selection 

+ **Selecting statistical analysis method**
	+ **Number of IVs**
		+ **One IV or >1 IV?**
	+ **Levels within the IVs**
		+ **IV has few levels (2 – 4) – difference question**
		+ **> 4 nominal levels – usually a difference question**
		+ **> 4 ordinal levels – associational question**
	+ **Measurement scale of the DV**
		+ **Level of measurement**

#  Statistical Analysis Selection 

+ **Selecting statistical analysis method**
	+ **Design classifications –**
		+ **Single-factor design**
			+ **Between-Groups vs Within-Subjects**
		+ **Factorial design (2 or more IVs)**
			+ **Between-Groups vs Within-Subjects vs Mixed**

****

#  Statistical Analysis Selection 

+ **Level of measurement**
	+ **Normal**
		+ **Highest level of measurement**
		+ **Parametric statistics assume normal distribution**
	+ **Ordinal**
		+ **3 or more ordered levels**
		+ **No assumption of normal distribution**
	+ **Nominal**
		+ **3 or more unordered levels**
	+ **Dichotomous**
		+ **Special case**
		+ **Nominal, but can be used as if normally distributed**

#  Statistical Analysis Selection 

+ **Level of measurement**
	+ **Difference inferential statistical analysis**
		+ **Level of measure for DV matters**
	+ **Associational inferential statistical analysis**
		+ **Need to consider level of measurement for all variables**

****

23

---
#  Statistical Analysis Selection 

+ **Parametric statistics – assumptions**
	+ **DV values come from a population of values that is normally distributed (normality)**
	+ **Variances of the groups are equal (homogeneity of variance)**
		+ **Unequal group sizes and unequal variances** **<U+F0E8> increased Type I errors**
	+ **All participants with a particular group must be independent of each other (independence)**
		+ **Also an assumption for nonparametric statistics**

#  Statistical Analysis Selection 

+ **Selecting statistical analysis method –**
	+ **RH/RQ – difference or association?**
		+ **If IV has 2 – 4 levels – recommend difference approach**
		+ **If IV has 5 or more ordered levels – recommend associational approach**
		+ **If IV has 5 or more nominal (unordered) levels – usually difference approach**
	+ **How many IVs?**

#  Assignment #10 

+ **Expand the “outline” for your research proposal to include information on the data analysis that will be needed for your proposed study. In addition to a description of the steps that are planned for preliminary data review (e.g., check distribution of measures, check item reliability of scales), the outline should consist of a description of analyses that are planned to address each research hypothesis/question.** ****
