#  Internal Validity 

+ **“The extent to which we can infer that the independent variable** ***caused*** **the dependent variable.”**
	+ **For non-experimental studies –**
		+ **How “well designed and conducted” was the study?**
+ **Three criteria for causality**

#  Internal Validity 

+ **“The extent to which we can infer that the independent variable** ***caused*** **the dependent variable.”**
+ **Three criteria for causality**
	+ **IV** ***must precede*** **the outcome variable**
	+ **IV** ***must be related*** **to the outcome**
	+ **There must** **be no other variables that could explain why the IV is related to the** **outcome**

#  Internal Validity 

+ **Three criteria for causality –**
	+ **IV** ***must precede*** **the outcome variable**
	+ **IV** ***must be related*** **to the outcome**
	+ **There must** **be no other variables that could explain why the IV is related to the** **outcome**
+ **By Research Approach –**
	+ **Randomized** **Exp**
	+ **Quasi-** **Exp**
	+ **Comparative**
	+ **Associational**
	+ **Descriptive**

#  Internal Validity 

+ **Meeting the 3 causality criteria based on –**
	+ **Strength of the research design**
	+ **Internal validity**

#  Internal Validity 

+ **Internal validity -**
	+ **Most often discussed with reference to randomized experimental and quasi-experimental designs**
	+ **Can also be applied to non-experimental studies**

#  Internal Validity 

+ **Evaluating the internal validity of a study –**
	+ **Equivalence of the groups on participant characteristics**
	+ **Control of extraneous experiences and environmental variables**


.footnote[MEDB 5510 - Week 7 - Part 1]

---
#  Internal Validity 

+ **Equivalence of the groups on participant characteristics –**
	+ **Are groups equivalent prior to introduction of IV?**
		+ **Randomized experimental design –**
			+ **Random assignment**
		+ **Quasi-experimental design –**
			+ **Random assignment of treatments**
			+ **Matching**
			+ **Checking pretest scores**

#  Internal Validity 

+ **Equivalence of the groups on participant characteristics –**
	+ **Are groups equivalent prior to introduction of IV?**
		+ **Comparative design –**
			+ **Statistical adjustment (ANCOVA) to adjust DV scores to make groups more nearly equivalent**
			+ **Matching participants on variables other than the primary IV**
				+ **E.g. Case-control study**
			+ **Check after the study for comparability**

#  Internal Validity 

+ **Equivalence of the groups on participant characteristics –**
	+ **Are groups equivalent prior to introduction of IV?**
		+ **Associational design –**
			+ **Only 1 group**
			+ **Not able to provide evidence of causation**
			+ **“Equivalence” – “… whether those who score high on the IV … are similar to those … who score low in terms of other attributes that may be related to the DV.”**
			+ **May be able to provide some statistical control**

#  Internal Validity 

+ **Control of extraneous experiences and environmental** **variables** **–**
	+ **Extraneous variables – variables other than the IV and DV**
	+ **Environmental variables – conditions/variables that occur during the study**
	+ **Contamination**
	+ **Issue – Is one group affected more than the other(s)?**
	+ **Less of an issue with a more controlled research setting**

#  Internal Validity 

+ **Rating the dimensions of internal validity**
	+ **Figure 8.2**
	+ **Evaluating Research Validity framework**
	+ **“Good” study – moderate to high internal validity on both dimensions**

#  Threats to Internal Validity

.footnote[MEDB 5510 - Week 7 - Part 1]

---
#  Threats to Internal Validity 

+ **Equivalence of Groups**
	+ **Use of extreme groups**
	+ **Participant dropouts or attrition during the study**
	+ **Bias in assignment to groups**


.footnote[MEDB 5510 - Week 7 - Part 1]

---
#  Threats to Internal Validity 

+ **Control of extraneous/environmental variables**
	+ **Changes due to time or growth and development**
	+ **Extraneous environmental events**
	+ **Repeated testing, carryover effects**
	+ **Instrument or observer inconsistency**
	+ **Combinations of two or more threats**
	+ **Did the IV actually occur before the DV?**

#  Threats to Internal Validity 

+ **Other threats**
	+ **Effects of being in the control group**
	+ **Expectation effect**
		+ **Control for expectation**
	+ **Observer / experimenter bias**
