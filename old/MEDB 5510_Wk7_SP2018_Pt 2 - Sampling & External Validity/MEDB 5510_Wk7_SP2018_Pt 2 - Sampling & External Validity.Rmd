#  Sampling 

+ **“… process of selecting** ***part*** **of a larger group of participants with the intent of generalizing from the sample (the smaller group) to the population (the larger group).”**
	+ **“… representativeness of the sample is more important than its size …”**

#  Sampling 

+ **Sample size**
	+ **General rules**
		+ **Representativeness** **vs** **number**
		+ **Impact of having very large sample sizes**
	+ **Generally –**
		+ **Need sample to be large enough so you don’t miss important findings**
		+ **If very large sample, need to distinguish statistical significance** **vs** **clinically important**

#  External Validity 

+ **Population external validity**
	+ **How participants were selected for the study?**
	+ **Is sample representative of the target population?**
	+ **Validity framework**
