### Assignment

1. Generate a list of measures that you plan to include in your research proposal. This should be a general list of measures and not necessarily a detailed list of the specific type of measure to be used. For instance, you might list the outcome measure “health” and not specify the exact measure of health status that you will use. This assignment will be a first draft of the "measures" description included in the Methods section of your research proposal.

2. Prepare for next week’s session
