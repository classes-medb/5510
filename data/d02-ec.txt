#### D02-EC. Extra credit discussion (1 point)

Extra credit (one point). Find a research article or an article in the popular press that relates to the material discussed in this week's class. I am particularly interested in different case studies of ethics, empirical studies of the extent of the problem with unethical research, or a commentary on the need for additional regulation (or the need for less regulation) of clinical research. If the article is available to anyone, post the link. If it is behind a pay wall, include a copy of the article as an attachment.
