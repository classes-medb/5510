### Discussion questions

Please submit your posts by <<due date>> and comment on at least one other post by the following Wednesday.

1. There are several readings suggested in addition to the chapters in your book. Most of these involve case studies of research ethics. Take one of the articles and offer some commentary about it. You are also welcome to offer commentary on a different case study that you find interesting. Your commentary could be identifying who is the "hero" and who is the "villain" or suggesting what might have been done differently. You might comment on an experience that you have had that relates to the case study (but please don't share anything that should be kept confidential). You are also welcome (and encouraged) to comment on someone else's commentary rather than providing your own original commentary, though please do this respectfully. Also make sure that you comments are constructive and add something of value to the discussion.

2. Find a published guidelines on research ethics and the responsible conduct of research. It could be as broad as the Declaration of Helsinki, or it could be something that is specific to your field of work. It could cover ethics in general or ethics restricted to a particular area like authorship guidelines. Post a brief summary in your own words of what this summary covers.

3. Review the summary provided by another student (or by me) and comment on it.  Try to mention something that you find surprising, something that is quite different in your particular discipline, something that you disagree with, or something that you think was left out.

Extra credit. Find a research article or an article in the popular press that relates to the material discussed in this week's class. I am particularly interested in different case studies of ethics, empirical studies of the extent of the problem with unethical research, or a commentary on the need for additional regulation (or the need for less regulation) of clinical research. If the article is available to anyone, post the link. If it is behind a pay wall, include a copy of the article as an attachment.

Not for a grade. Start thinking about a research problem that you might want to develop a research plan for. If you can identify one now, post it on the discussion board for this week (I'll keep the discussion board open if it takes you several weeks to settle on a research problem). If you want to run your research problem by me first, send it by email and I will offer some feedback. This assignment will not be graded and it's okay to change your research problem if you find out something new in the lectures or readings or as you begin to work on the plan for this research problem.
