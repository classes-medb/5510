### Discussion questions

Please submit your posts by <<due date>> and comment on at least one other post by the following Wednesday.

1. Read my blog post "Recommended: When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy" and click the New York Times article link and some of the others. What do you think about the article? Has Dr. Cuddy been treated unfairly?

OR

2. Read my blog post "Recommended: Congratulations on the Promotion. But Did Science Get a Demotion" and click on the main link. I disagreed quite strongly with the conclusions, but think it is worth reading. What is your impression of the article?

OR 

3. Read the graphic comic "The Facts in the Case of Andrew Wakefield" written and drawn by Darryl Cunningham. It is a very strong condemnation of Dr. Wakefield. Do you feel that this is a fair portrayal of him?

OR

4. Read Paul Gelsinger's account of his son, Jesse Gelsinger, who died in a gene therapy trial.
