### Discussion questions

1. Find a literature review that is part of a research paper that you find interesting. This can be the same research paper that you discussed earlier or it can be a different paper. How many paragraphs long is this literature review and how many papers did it cite? What organizational structure did it use (chronological, broad to specific, of thematic)?

Please be sure to include a link to the article if the full free text is available, or attach a PDF file if the article is behind a pay wall.

2. Read and comment on someone else's literature review, pointing out an additional positive or negative feature of that literature review.

3. You have the choice of index cards, a spreadsheet, or bibliographic management software to organize your literature review. You don't have to commit to any of these now, but find a website or article that talks about the notecard or spreadsheet approach or which offers a positive review of a bibliographic software program. Share a link and offer a brief summary (three to four sentences).

Extra credit. There are hundreds of excellent guides on how to write a literature review. Find one that you like (other than the ones I have already recommended) and offer a brief (three to four sentence) summary. Please be sure to include a link to the article if the full free text is available, or attach a PDF file if the article is behind a pay wall.
