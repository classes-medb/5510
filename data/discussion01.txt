Please submit your posts by <<due date>> and comment on at least one other post by the following Wednesday.

1. Briefly describe your background and explain why are you interested in this course?

2. Find a research paper that is relevant to your work or area of study. This must be a paper with full free text available. Post the abstract of this article and a link to the full text. Review the dichotomies discussed in Chapter 1 and classify the paper into one of the two levels in each dichotomy, or classify it as a mixture of both levels of the dichotomies. If you are unsure about any classification, be honest about your uncertainty.

3. Review at least one paper posted by another student and comment on their classifications.
