### Assignment

1. Submit your literature review. Use the format style suggested for the School of Graduate Studies, even if you do not plan to submit to use this work for a thesis. Several guides are available, including YouTube vidoes on this page in [html format](https://sgs.umkc.edu/current-students/thesis-dissertation-guidelines/). 

It may seem like overkill, but please use the suggested format for the

* cover page, 
* copyright notice, and
* approval page.

Where the abstract would normally go, just place the word "ABSTRACT" in the proper font size, followed by the text line "This section to be completed at a later date," again in the proper font size. Do the same for the list of illustrations, and  the list of tables. You can include an acknowledgements page and/or a dedication page if you like, but these are optional.

Please follow the recommendations for margins and location of page numbers. You will be graded on the accuracy of details like these. 

Again, it seems like overkill, but include a table of contents. No page numbers are needed here, but please note the use of roman numerals for the preliminary pages in this format.

Then include  the "Introduction" section. You can include some text here, if you like, or you can just use the text line "This section to be completed at a later date." 

The next section is where you insert your literature review. If you have not already stated your research problem/hypothesis in the introduction, please include it in the first or the last paragraph of your literature review.

Follow the introduction with the remaining section headers of what would be your research paper. The UMKC thesis guidelines suggest 

* Methodology,
* Results, and 
* Discussion,

but you can choose whatever headings you think might be appropriate. Do not include any text for any of these sections, except for the text line "This section to be completed at a later date," in the proper font size. 

End with your reference list. For now, only include references that are part of your literature review. Your references MUST conform either with a commonly used standard, but I do not require you to use any particular standard. You should consider a standard that you expect to use with a future journal you might publish in. Please include a link to whichever bibliographic standard you choose at the bottom of your reference list.

You can include your vita (note that the example is just a brief narrative). I think it would fun for you to brag about all the great things you've already done, but it is optional.

You will not be graded on any optional sections that you decide to include.

There are no page requirements and no requirements for a particular number of references. You do need to present a reasonable comprehensive literature review, but the length may vary depending on your topic.

Here is the grading rubric for your literature review. There are 30 points total on this assignment.

### Formatting of main paper

Unsatisfactory (0 points) No serious attempt made to use the layout required.

Marginal (2 points) Major deviations from the layout.

Satisfactory (4 points) Follows the required format with only minor departures from the layout.

Outstanding (6 points) No deviations from the required format.

### Formatting of the bibliography

Unsatisfactory (0 points) Bibliography is incomplete. References are formatted inconsistently.

Marginal (2 points) Bibliography is formatted consistently, but fails to conform to major aspects of the standard you have chosen.

Satisfactory (4 points) The bibliography follows the general structure of the standard you have chosen but there are more than a few minor deviations.

Outstanding (6 points) No more than two minor deviations from the bibliographic standard.

### Organization

Unsatisfactory (0 points) References are described in a totally random or haphazard fashion.

Marginal (2 points) Organization is difficult to follow and is applied inconsistently.

Satisfactory (4 points) Similar references are grouped in the same paragraph and each paragraph .

Outstanding (6 points) References organized clearly with logical transitions within a paragraph. Individual paragraphs defined clearly with a topic sentence and follow from one paragraph to another using coherent organizational style.

### Grammar/spelling

Unsatisfactory (0 points) Spelling errors and grammar mistakes make the literature review impossible to follow

Marginal (2 points) Serious spelling or grammar errors which interfere with readability.

Satisfactory (4 points) More than a few errors, but most are minor and none interfere substantially with readability.

Outstanding (6 points) Only two or three errors at most and all errors are minor.

### Clarity

(Note: I understand that research requires the description of concepts that are difficult for the average person to understand. Try to write in a style that allows an expert from a different discipline to follow what you are talking about).

Unsatisfactory (0 points) Writing is impossible to follow.

Marginal (2 points) Heavy use of jargon, acronyms, and undefined terms.

Satisfactory (4 points) Writing is difficult at times, but the general idea comes across.

Outstanding (6 points) Clear and simple explanations of concept topics. Language avoids excessive use of jargon.
