### Assignment

1. Submit your literature review. Use the format style suggested for PLOS|ONE, which is available in [html format](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines). Start with a properly formatted title and author list (for now, only include one author, yourself). Then, where the abstract would normally go, just place the word "Abstract" in the proper font, followed by two blank lines. Then include "Introduction" and insert your literature review. The first or the last paragraph (your choice) should summarize your research question/hypothesis. Follow the introduction with the remaining section headers of what would be your research paper (Materials, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion). Do not include any text for any of these sections, but leave two blank lines. End with your reference list. For now, only include references that are in your introduction section. Your references MUST conform with the Vancouver standards, as documented on the PLOS|ONE website.

Here is the grading rubric for your literature review.

Satisfactory (4 points) More than a few errors, but most are minor and none interfere substantially with readability.

Outstanding (6 points) Only two or three errors at most and all errors are minor.
