### Discussion questions

1. What is meant by the “null hypothesis” versus a “research hypothesis”; which is being tested by the statistical analysis of the data; and can you “prove” a null hypothesis?

2. Will you include research questions or research hypotheses in your research proposal?

3. Do you have information available that is needed to determine sample size for your planned research project?

4. What outcome variables will be the focus of your research questions/hypotheses?
