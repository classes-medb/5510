## Submission format

Unless otherwise noted, all material that is submitted to Dr. Simon must be submitted via the course Canvas site and should be .docx (or .doc) format. [Note – Assignment 1 – certification of IRB training – can be sent as a .pdf file.) All files sent to Dr. Simon must include the student’s name in the filename. If a file is submitted that does not include the student’s name, Dr. Simon will reply telling the student to resend the file with their name included in the filename.
