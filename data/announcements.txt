    5/6/2018 - A couple of notes based on review of oral presentaitons Click for more options

    Posted on: Sunday, May 6, 2018 11:30:10 PM CDT

    A couple of final general notes after I have reviewed the oral presentations.

     

    1) Make sure you include information that addresses your sample size. This could be (a) information on the power analysis you conducted to determine the sample sized needed to be recruited/enrolled in a prospective study, or (b) the effect size you will be able to detect given the sample size you have available to use from an existing resource, or (c) the sample size available that will give you stable estimates, or (d) how your proposed sample size compares to other studies that have been conducted in the field.

     

    2) When describing the analyses you have planned to address your RQ/RH, BE SURE to include a restatement of the RQ/RH being addressed. As I’ve previously stated – this is to keep the reader/reviewer from having to hunt through the document to find this info – don’t ask that person to do this extra work. Note – Brock did a really nice job of doing this and I recommend that you look at this part of his oral presentation to see how he did it. This is an important element of the stats sub-section that I have repeatedly emphasized, so I expect to see it.

     

    I’m looking forward to reading the written proposals, especially after reviewing the oral presentations – good work on these!

    I consulted with Panopto support and they showed me the setting I needed to set so that you can see each other recordings.

    Reminder - oral presentation recording AND poster material file due by the end of the day today (by midnight). Your next priority is to complete your written proposal which is due by the end of the day next Tuesday, May 8th.

    People have started uploading their oral presentations in the Student Oral Presentations ... folder under the Panopto Video section of the course Blackboard site. There are 4 currently available that I can see and hear. To get to them, I to to Panopto Video, then click on the Student Oral Presentations ... table TWICE.

    I've heard from a student that she can not see other students' recordings yet. I'm going to talk to support today to find out if there is some setting that needs to be changed. Please let me know if you look for students' recordings and can't see or hear any of the ones that have been uploaded.

    I take seriously my part in setting up and contribution to the discussion forums. I think the crucial aspect of the discussion forums that make the online course format work, however, is for there to be active student involvement. Thanks to all for your contributions – you’ve done a great job!!

     

    Note – I’ve been compiling resources information that has been posted in the discussion forums. I’ve uploaded that file into the Course Content folder. Feel free to download and review – there have been some great suggestions for additional resources. (Resources referenced in discussion forums / References etc from discussion forums.pdf)

     

    In order to allow you to focus on the final projects, there will only be 1 discussion forum for Week 15 to be used as you have a need. I will moderate and handle any questions regarding the final projects – oral presentation, poster material, and written research proposal. Even if you don’t think you have a question, be sure to review postings to check for useful information. I will post 3 participation points for Week 16 for everyone, regardless of your use of this discussion forum. Think of it as extra credit that everyone is getting.

     

    Note – I have compiled assessment items and uploaded them to the Week 15 folder. Feel free to review for your own use.

     

    For the upcoming week (Thursday, 4/26/2018 through Thursday 5/3/2018) – FOCUS ON FINAL PROJECTS

I've done this instead of repeatedly typing in the information as feedback to the last assignment that I'm currently reviewing. You are responsible for using this information to make sure your proposal is complete. Please use the available resources to make your proposal the best it can be.

    Great discussions again this week. I think it has worked out well for me to give specific feedback on people’s projects and their questions, so I’ll include a forum to be used as needed for the same purpose. There are 3 discussion forums for this week. The first one is the usual assessment item forum that I will moderate. I’ve assigned Kate & Ryan to moderate Forum #2 for Week 14. The 3rd forum is the one I’ll moderate and it can be used as you have a need. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU MAY NEED TO GO TO A 2ND PAGE IN THE DISCUSSION BOARD TO SEE THE FORUMS FOR WEEK 14.

     

    For the upcoming week (Thursday, 4/19/2018 through Wednesday, 4/25/2018) –

                    - Participate in the Week 14 discussion forums. Remember to post by the end of Sunday to get that point for early participation; total points awarded based on participation through next Wednesday.

    I’ve reviewed and uploaded my feedback files for assignment #9 – draft structure of your proposal. In general, people are making great progress. Please note that my feedback is preparing about structure and making sure you have all the pieces needed. Don’t expect that I am providing feedback on your specific content – I was focused on the structure to make sure you had the required pieces.

     

    Some general comments –

                   Use the available resources for what is expected. This includes the grading rubric, the instructional information on the proposal structure, including formatting instructions, and the 3 exemplar proposals that are from a previous class.

                   You should assume that I am providing formatting information for a reason – just like any institution you might be applying to for funding or other purposes will have formatting instructions for what they expect. If you don’t following my formatting and structure instructions, you WILL lose points.

                   Make sure you include somewhere in the Methods and Materials section/chapter information that justifies the sample size you have in your proposed study. This can be addressed from a number of different perspectives.

                                  If your study is a prospective study, you need to use power analysis to justify the sample size you are proposing.

                                  If your study is using an existing data resource and you are testing relationships or comparing groups, then you can talk about the effect size you will be able to significantly detect given the sample size you have available.

                                  If your study is using an existing data resource and you are doing a descriptive/exploratory study, you can talk about having the sample size necessary to provide stable estimates.

     

    Your final assignment is to build on the structure you submitted for assignment #9, and include the stats sub-section. I expect that your stats analysis sub-section will have several different parts to it.
        Preliminary analyses to examine the data, compute sample descriptive characteristics, …
        Analyses to address each RQ/RH. You should restate each RQ/RH and then describe the analysis that will be done to address it.

    Great discussions again this week. I am really glad I pulled in the “problematic items” forum so you could look at this information and discuss the issues. As you have the opportunity to develop your own survey items, you can keep these examples in mind so you avoid the mistakes! Thanks to all the students who moderated the forums. There are 2 discussion forums for this week. The first one is the usual assessment item forum that I will moderate. I’ve assigned Jonathan & Neil to moderate Forum #2 for Week 13.

    Several of the items refer to the Table in the textbook - "Power for a Two-tailed t Test ..." When I created the items (#5, #6, ...) I was looking at the 2nd edition of the textbook when I referred to page 239. I've now looked at the 3rd edition of the textbook and found that the table is on page 294. I just wanted to clear up any confusion I might have caused when I referred to the table in these items.

    I’ve uploaded my feedback files for the 2nd Measures assignment. You are making great progress on pulling together this information.

     

    General note - The reason I suggest both a table and text detailed description in the Measures sub-section is because of the different purpose that the table has compared to the detail in the text. The table provides a list of measures that are going to be collected, with organization by useage, that makes it easy to refer to as someone is reading other parts of the proposal. The text provides the detail needed to fully understand the measures you will be collecting and using. Remember, you are preparing a proposal to be read and reviewed by someone who doesn’t necessarily have the detailed knowledge that you have on your topic. Therefore, you need to make sure you are provided all the information that is needed to fully describe what you plan to do and to provide them with the detail they need to evaluate your plans.

     

    As you continue to develop your proposal, remember that I have uploaded three exemplar proposals for review in the Course Content folder in the course Blackboard site.

    I have uploaded into the Course Content folder of the course Blackboard site 3 exemplar proposals I received the last time the class was taught. I selected these three because they scored highly, and they cover a wide range of topics. Please note that #2 has a lit review section/chapter that is longer than expected; this topic was the focus of the student's thesis project, so she had extensive literature she was preparing for her thesis proposal. Don't feel like you need to match the length of her lit review.

    I have uploaded my feedback on assignment #7 - measures. You may have time to incorporate this feedback into the assignment that is due by the end of the day today, but I know you might not have enough time to made adjustments based on this feedback for assignment #8. The important thing is to review and incorporate the feedback as you continue to develop your proposal

    Generally - the Measures sub-section is where you demonstrate your knowledge and the thought you've put into your study plan. You should be listing and describing all measures that will be collected for each unit/case in your dataset. These variables/measures need to be appropriate given the RQ/RH you are planning to address, and the analyses you plan to use need to be appropriate for these variables given the RQ/RH you are addressing. This is part of completing the circle of the research planning process - what is your question/topic; what info do you need in order to address this; what are the analyses that will be right to address the RQ/RH you propose.

    General - continued good work on developing your project. Refer to the grading rubric to get a sense of relative size/weight of each section and sub-section so you know what the expectations are. Some of you included the start of your stats sections. These need to be extensive enough to include a description of the preliminary analyses you will conduct, including sample characteristics, and the planned analyses to address each RQ/RH. This description should include a re-statement of each RQ/RH so that the purpose of the analyses are clearly stated.

    I'm traveling this week and this has affected my ability to keep to my regular schedule. I am continuing to work on the lit review drafts and will make that my top priority to complete. Then I will compile the assessment items and review the research design assignment. Because my schedule has been affected by travel, I will make an appropriate adjustment in terms of the schedule for the Week 10 discussion forums.

    As a reminder - Assignment 7 (list of measures) is due by the end of today - Wednesday, March 21, 2018. Next week is Spring Break - please refer to the calendar I posted in the Course Content section of the course Blackboard site for a reminder of the adjusted dates to work around Spring Break.

    Thanks for all the great discussion in the forums. The Discussion Forums are continuing to be great from my perspective. I’ve seen great discussion on both forums and appreciate the information sharing that occurs on the forums. Thanks to Emily & Poghni for moderating Week 8 Forum #2. I’ve assigned Frances & Brock to moderate Forum #2 for Week 9.

     

    I’m completing the feedback on Assignment #5 – draft lit review. I plan to have them returned to all of you by the end of the day on Friday.

    The Discussion Forums are continuing to be great from my perspective. I’ve seen great discussion on both forums and appreciate the information sharing that occurs on the forums. Thanks to Alyx & Tabitha for their moderation of Forum #2. I’ve assigned Emily & Poghni to moderate Forum #2 for week 8.

     

    Assignment #4 (lit search) – I’ve uploaded my feedback for the lit search assignment. Generally, I provided brief feedback for this assignment. The feedback for the draft mlit review assignment (#5) will be more extensive. As you continue to develop your proposal, I expect that you may be including additional citations/references, including some that are needed to support your methods/procedures. As I’ve noted, you can use a citation/referencing style that is most familiar to you or most commonly used in the professional literature you most often refer to. What I do insist on, however, is that you are consistent with the style you have selected. In the Week 14 folder I have provided a couple of resources for AMA style. For whatever style you select, please be aware of the difference in reference style for journal articles you get through an online resource (e.g., epub of journal through a library resource) versus an online source that you are referencing (e.g., web site resource). If you are citing a journal article that has been published and you got the article through an online link (i.e., library link to the journal), you should use the standard reference format following the style you are using.

     

    Assignment #6 (brief description of research design) – due by the end of day, Wednesday, 3/14/2018. Use the link that is in the Week 8 folder for this submission.

     

    For the upcoming week (Thursday, 3/8/2018 through Wednesday, 3/14/2018) –

                   - Participate in the Week 8 discussion forums. Remember to post by the end of Sunday to get that point for early participation; total points awarded based on participation through next Wednesday.

                   - Prepare for the Week 9 session –

                                  - Review reading material

                                  - Review recordings

                                  - Submit assessment items by the end of Tuesday, 3/13/2018.

                   - Submit Assignment #6 (brief description of research design) by the end of day, Wednesday, 3/147/2018. The submission link is in the Week 8 folder.

    The Discussion Forums are continuing to be great from my perspective. I’ve seen great discussion on both forums and appreciate the information sharing that occurs on the forums. I’ve uploaded into the Week 6 folder the table reporting the coding of the qualitative information that the project team completed. You can see how your themes overlap with what the project team came up with. Thanks to Raj & Nikki for their moderation of Forum #2. I’ve assigned Alyx & Tabitha to moderate Forum #2 for week 7.

     

    Assignment #4 (lit search) - I’ve downloaded the available files and posted points based on submission. I’ll be reviewing the files and sending you feedback/comments by early next week.

     

    Assignment #5 (draft lit review) – due by the end of day, Wednesday, 3/7/2018. This should be a first draft of your lit review. I’ll review and give you feedback. You will use a Turn-it-in link that is in the Week 7 folder for this submission. I’ve provided an OPTIONAL link that can be used for a practice submission – your choice. I’m really excited about the range of study ideas that are being worked on and I look forward to reviewing your draft lit review.

     

    For the upcoming week (Thursday, 3/1/2018 through Wednesday, 3/7/2018) –

    The Discussion Forums are continuing to be great from my perspective. I’ve really enjoyed reading everyone’s input, and appreciate the inclusion of additional resources. I’m keeping a list of resources that you have provided for future reference. Thanks to Doaa & Dave for their moderation of Forum #2. I’ve assigned Raj & Nikki to moderate Forum #2 for week 6.

     

    Reminder – although the vast majority of times, submissions are made as it asked - .docx file with your name/initials included in the file name. There continue to be a few cases where this is not done. This creates extra work for me – either because I have to ask you to submit a .docx file or I have to rename the file to include your name/initials. Starting with assignment #3 you will see how I review your assignments and give you feedback. I use “track changes” and upload a file with my edits/comments/questions for your review. I’m confident that everyone knows what I’ve asked, and they just occasionally forget to do either of those 2 things. From now on, I will not review an assignment or give it points until it is submitted as requested. This may sound picky of me, but sometimes readers/reviewers have specific submission requirements that make the difference to your submission being reviewed or not! As professionals we should all take the extra step of making sure we have done what is asked.

     

    Assignment #3 – Some who submitted early have already gotten my feedback in the form of their .docx file with notes/comments/edits noted. Blackboard support told me that you should be able to see this file by clicking on the original submission link. This is not something I can check from my side of things. If there is any question, please be sure to check with Blackboard support (x6700).

     

    For the upcoming week (Thursday, 2/22/2018 through Wednesday, 2/28/2018) –

                   - Participate in the Week 6 discussion forums. Remember to post by the end of Sunday to get that point for early participation; total points awarded based on participation through next Wednesday.

                   - Prepare for the Week 7 session –

                                  - Review reading material

                                  - Review recordings

                                  - Submit assessment items by the end of Tuesday, 2/27/2018.

                   - Submit Assignment #4 (results of a literature search on the topic you are planning for your final project) by the end of day, Wednesday, 2/28/2018. The submission link is in the Week 6 folder. The “results” you send for this assignment can be represented by a reference list of articles that are relevant to your topic. I do NOT expect a lit review at this point – that will be the next assignment. This assignment should demonstrate that you have found relevant literature for your topic.

     

    Remember – review points that are awarded for participation, assessment items, & assignments. If you have a question about anything, contact me via email.

    Great job on Assignment #2 – Secondary Dataset research study idea. (Note – if you haven’t yet submitted the assignment, be sure to do so. You will lose points based on how late it is, but you will still get some points and you will get feedback that could help you in the future.) CHECK THE GRADE DETAILS FOR THE ASSIGNMENT – you will be able to see the feedback I provided.

     

    I’m really enjoying the discussion forums – you are doing a great job on the topics. The discussion I’ve reviewed confirms for me the value that can be gained with online discussions. I have posted the Week 5 Discussion Forums. I will moderate the assessment items forum, as usual, and I’ve assigned Doaa Aly & Dave Walsh to moderate the 2nd forum.

    Week 4 Update Click for more options

    Posted on: Tuesday, February 6, 2018 4:06:40 PM CST

    In addition to the information that was already on the course Blackboard site for Week 4, the following items have been added -

    Week 4 folder -

         Supporting slides for Dr. Hickman's presentation on a type of use of datasets available through the Health Care Utilization Project resource.

         DBHI list of secondary data resources that are available.

    Panopto Video -

         Recording of Dr. Tim Hickman's presentation on HCUP uses to get summary data from various resources.

    Note - The use of HCUP resources that Dr. Hickman covers is a really good option to provide preliminary data to justify the extent of a clinical issue, how much of an impact there is, and other aspects. You get summary tables through this use of HCUP rather than working with the actual raw data. Note that many of the HCUP data resources are based on "events" rather than "people." In other words, the numbers that are reported in the summary table represent things like the "number of inpatient admissions" or "number of admission to the emergency department.

    Given when this info is being posted, I'm not sure if there will be many, if any, assessment items that represent this info. That's OK - it is still important information for you to know about in terms of working with these resources.

    I've posted participation points for Week 2 - If you have any question about what is posted, send me an email to discuss.

    Although I created some confusion with the submission of the 1st assignment by not getting the syllabus completely edited, all subsequent submissions should be made through a link provided in a weekly folder. If there is any deviation from this, I'll be sure to let you know.

    Be sure to review the library resources material in the Week 3 folder if you haven't already.

    There is no assignment due this coming week, but assessment items will be due as usual by the end of the day next Tuesday.

    Discussion forums have been posted, and the Week 3 assessment item compiled file is available in the Week 3 folder. I've assigned student moderators for one of the discussion forums - Firas & Jason. Keep an eye out of on subsequent discussions to look for when I've assigned you as a moderator.

    Discussion Forum participation Click for more options

    Posted on: Monday, January 29, 2018 11:28:53 AM CST

    A student emailed me to get clarification on discussion forum participation - he wanted to make sure he was doing enough to meet my expectations without expending more time/effort than what is appropriate. I think this is a very reasonable question and I'm glad he asked - it gave me a chance to clarify in my own mind what is appropriate and use this announcement to clarify it for you. 

    I expect that there will be at least 2 discussion forums each week. In an ideal world (i.e., a world where you have nothing else going on in your life except this class!), I would like/expect people to meet the participation criteria for each forum, I know we don't like in an ideal world as defined as nothing else matters except my class :) Therefore, participation expectations are based on your overall participation for the week, across all forums that are posted. In other words, you can make your own posting on one forum and respond to another student's posting on another forum, and that will be acceptable. Naturally, you are welcome and encouraged to post as much as you want - I have found that more participation greatly increases the value of the discussion forums.

    Based on the above and wanting you to get as much out of the different types of forums that are set-up, I recommend the following -

    - Make your own posting on one of the forums, and respond to another student's posting on a different forum.

    - Since one of the forums each week will always be a discussion of the assessment items, switch up whether your make your original post or re-post in the assessment forum. In other words, one week you could make your original post to the assessment item forum and the next week you could re-post to the assessment forum.

    I hope this clarifies expectations. Please feel free to contact me with any other questions.

    I've posted Discussion Forums for Week 2 - 1) Assessment items, and 2) Research ethics. There is a 3rd optional one you can use if you have any questions regarding the lecture material.

    From today, you should be participating in the Week 2 discussion forums, preparing to submit Week 3 assessment items (due by next Tuesday), and submitting your 1st assignment - IRB training certificate which is due by the end of the day next Wednesday.

    I hope everyone is getting comfortable with the flipped nature of the class which means you are juggling both discussion from the current week and preparation for the next week's topic.

    Participation points for discussion activities each week are based on Input into the discussion forums that are made through midnight, each Wednesday. Remember that you can earn up to 3 participation points each week using the following system -

    1 pt for making an entry into a discussion forum

    1 pt for making an initial entry by midnight, each Sunday

    1 pt for responding to another student's entry

    We are already starting out with some interaction which is great to see. There are some students, however, who haven't made any entry yet, and several who haven't responded to other students. This is your choice, naturally, but I just wanted to remind you of the participation point system. I'll post participation points for each week after Wednesday, midnight. If you feel there has been an error in what I record, please feel free to contact me so I can review and make sure I haven't missed something.

    There is information in the Start Here tab.

    The syllabus is posted in the Syllabus tab.

    You can find videos in the Panopto Video tab. I've named them and included a number in the video name indicating the order they should be viewed.

    I've loaded some basic course information in the Course Content tab.

    There are items loaded in the Week 1 folder of the Week by Week tab.

    I will be posting a discussion forum for Week 1 on Thursday in the Discussion Board tab.

    I have designated Thursday as the "class day" for this course. I use this to time assignment dates, etc. I believe I have fully explained how this online course will be structured in the first 2 videos you should watch.
