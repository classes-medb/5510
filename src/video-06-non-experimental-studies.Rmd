### Research Approaches 

![](../images/image-06-01.png)

<div class="notes">

Going back to the figure that we have used. Now we will talk about comparative, associational, and descriptive studies.

Now you are talking about an attribute independent variable, one that you cannot manipulate or control. You can talk about causality easily for a randomized design but these three designs do not allow you to say anything about causality.

</div>

***
### Nonexperimental Designs 

![](../images/image-06-02.png)

<div class="notes">

Figure 7.1 identifies the five types of designs (descriptive, associational, comparative, quasi-experimental, and randomized experimental).

These three non-experimental approaches differ the levels of the independent variable. A large number of ordered levels (equivalent to a continuous independent variable) falls in the associational research type.

DiLorenzo compared older patients to younger patients.

Haberer article includes both quantitative and qualitative research. Interactive voice response (IVR) versus short message service (SMS) as a way of collecting adherence. It is an HIV study where adherence is very important. Mobile technology has a lot of penetration in places like Africa. Parents that could read were randomized, but parents who could not read were assigned to IVR.

They did qualitative interviews with all participants. The first theme was poor understanding of the responses. A second theme was challenges in training. The participants did not feel able to speak up and say that they don't understand.

</div>

***
### Research Approaches 

+ Comparative research approach
	+ Purpose?
	+ How is this approach similar to randomized experimental and quasi-experimental?
	+ C an this approach tell you anything about cause and effect?

<div class="notes">

Look at the very end of the introduction to get at the purpose of the research. Review the participant.

Random selection is a better representation of the population. (External validity?)

In any prospective study, you are only getting information for those people who are willing to be part of the study.

</div>

***
### Nonexperimental Designs 

+ Quantitative – Comparative
	+ Comparing groups – 2 or more
	+ Main IV has only a few levels
	+ Statistical analysis –
		+ T ypically t-test or analysis of variance
	+ Example – DiLorenzo et al., 2004 article
+ Usually – research that is reported will contain elements of more than one design
	+ Example – Haberer et al., 2010 article

<div class="notes">

Often your research has the elements of more than one design.

</div>

***
### Research Approaches 

+ Associational research approach
	+ Purpose?
	+ Characteristics of the variables measured?
	+ Can this approach tell you anything about cause and effect?

<div class="notes">

The compliance study is a good example of when you often end up with mixed methods to get more out of 

The purpose is to find associations among variables. The variables collected are typically continuous. This type of approach does not tell you about cause and effect directly. The association might allow you to predict. Continuous really means many levels. The analyses are typically correlation based or multiple regression.

An article by Rowan illustrates this well. Clinical record review and state HIV data. Variations in the engagement in care continuum. Impact of outmigration and death. When you don't have data is it because they are no longer engaged in care, or maybe they have moved on to a different provider. Has care improved over the last five years?

What variables are associated with getting treatment to reduce viral loads. This paper also addresses how to handle people who you do not have complete follow-up on.

Example of smoking cessation usually assumes that anyone who disappears is categorized as a treatment failure.

</div>

***
### Nonexperimental Designs 

+ Quantitative – Associational
	+ IV is often continuous / has many levels of an ordered variable (typically 5 or more )
	+ Looking at the association between the IV(s) and the DV
	+ Statistical analysis –
		+ Correlation-based
		+ Multiple regression when there are multiple Ivs
	+ Example – Rowan et al. 2014 article

<div class="notes">



</div>

***
### Research Approaches 

+ Descriptive research approach
	+ Purpose?
	+ When usually used?
	+ Characteristics of the variables measured?
	+ Can this approach tell you anything about cause and effect?

<div class="notes">

Usually used for an exploratory. It could be characterization of surveys or polls. It might be performance reports.

</div>

***
### Nonexperimental Designs 

+ Quantitative – Descriptive
	+ Descriptive statistics
		+ Averages
		+ Percentages
		+ Histogram
		+ Frequency distribution
	+ Some publication of strictly descriptive studies
	+ More often – descriptive component of a study
		+ Describe the sample
	+ Example – Wolfe et al, 2006 study

<div class="notes">

The Wolfe study is a good example. This study is in Botswana. Effects of stigma and its effect on health related behaviors. Structured questions followed by open ended questions. They are reporting percentages.

</div>

***
### Nonexperimental Designs 

+ Qualitative – 5 main approaches
	+ Phenomenological
	+ Grounded theory
	+ Ethnographic
	+ Case study
	+ Narrative

<div class="notes">

Phenomenological: try to understand the meaning that people place on events in their life. Try to understand from the perspective of the individual.

Grounded theory: the goal is to generate theory from data collection: process, actions, interactions. The inferences that you take away need to be grounded in the data you collect. Try to avoid any prior expectations. Some people even recommend limiting the literature review because it might box you in.

You won't know your sample size until you start collecting your data. As you are coding this information, you will be developing categories. These are provisional, there may be revisions as you go along and so the coding process is dynamic and iterative. As coding develops, you may go back to earlier data. Seek disconfirming examples. This is a check of your validity. You can also have audits by an independent reviewer. You are trying to reflect the reality of human experience.

Ethnographic. Group of people who share the same culture.
	
Case study. A single case or group of related cases.

Narrative. Develop stories.

These approaches are all inductive. You are trying to develop a framework of understanding. Don't go in with a heavy set of expectations.

</div>

***
### Nonexperimental Designs 

+ Qualitative – Phenomenological
	+ A llow researcher to “… understand the meaning participants place onto “… events, phenomenon, and activities.”
	+ Goal – “… explain the essence of experiences lived by the participants.”
	+ Method – usually interviews

<div class="notes">



</div>

***
### Nonexperimental Designs 

+ Qualitative – Grounded Theory
	+ Goal – “… generate theory from data collected from participants.”
	+ “… focus on the process, actions, and interactions experienced by … participants.”
	+ Method – usually interviews

<div class="notes">



</div>

***
### Nonexperimental Designs 

+ Grounded theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967)
	+ Inferences firmly “ grounded ” in the data
	+ Prior theoretical expectations avoided
	+ Sampling proceeds parallel to data collection & analysis
	+ Categories regarded as provisional, subject to revision
	+ Research maintains skepticism, seeks disconfirming examples
	+ Ultimate purpose – construct coherent theory from the data

<div class="notes">



</div>

***
### Nonexperimental Designs 

+ Qualitative – Ethnographic
	+ Goal - “… describe a group of individuals who share the same culture.”
+ Qualitative – Case-study
	+ Goal – “…develop deep understanding of a case or cases.”
+ Qualitative – Narrative
	+ Goal – “… identify and report stories from the participants.”

<div class="notes">



</div>

### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Inductive process –
	+ Start with the specific (raw data / transcript)
	+ Develop a theoretical framework from the data
	+ Conceptual categories emerge from the data

<div class="notes">



</div>

***
### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Start the study with a research question
	+ This may provide a potential starting point for analyzing text
	+ If you do this, DO NOT let it prevent you from seeing what is in the text
+ Steps
	+ From raw data <U+F0E8> theory building
	+ “ Iterative ” process
		+ e.g. , as you are developing categories, check them back against the raw data – do they continue to reflect the original data?

<div class="notes">

Keep alert and look for things that come out in the material that you were not anticipating. As your categories, go back and compare them against the raw data. Make sure that you allow the data to guide you. Often coding from transcripts. But it is also good to have access to the original recordings. Sometimes there is a doubt about what some was saying (joking or sarcasm). Look for tone of voice and non-verbal cues.

Content analysis is a generic term, but you can look at things like ad messages in magazines that appeal to young adults.

Thematic analysis is looking for patterns.

</div>

***
### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Analysis process –
	+ Given research question, may have some idea of a general conceptual structure; serve only as a starting point
	+ Usually work from transcripts
	+ If possible, refer back to audio recordings when needed
	+ Q ualitative form of analysis
		+ Content analysis – analysis of the content of communication
		+ Thematic analysis – identifying patterns or themes in the data

<div class="notes">

Break up the text into "bits" that represent specific thoughts. Open coding lots of themes. Axial coding looks at the relationships between themes, builds a superstructure of ideas.

</div>

***
### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Category Formation – assign sections (data bits) to analytical categories/themes "coding"
	+ Summarizing the data by identifying similarities and differences / commonalities and contrasts
	+ Categories:
		+ More manageable units of information
		+ "open coding"
		+ Descriptive – Concrete
		+ Interpretive – Abstract
		+ Relational
	+ Cross-reference categories back to text
		+ Makes it easier to revise coding as needed

<div class="notes">

Software allows you to go back and forth between themes and the original text. Cross-referencing is important. Find examples easily. It helps provide validity checks. Does someone agree with your categorization.

Categories need to be faithful to the data. This is internal validity. But you need to place this in a broader understanding.

You need to be careful about trying to quantify this too much. Keep in mind that just because someone talks about something a lot does not mean that this is the most important thing to them. The most important thing might be something that people are uncomfortable talking about.

</div>

***
### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Category Formation
	+ Faithful to the data – "internal" aspect
	+ Meaningful to other categories – “ external ” aspect
	+ Balance
		+ Generality vs Specificity
		+ Inclusivity vs Exclusivity
	+ Number of times idea mentioned does NOT necessarily reflect importance

<div class="notes">



</div>

***
### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Labeling / Revising Categories
	+ Member-generated – “ first-order ” account
	+ Observer-generated – “ second-order ” account
	+ Labels are provisional; may be revised
	+ Iteration – move back and forth between raw data and labeled categories
	+ “ Zoom in ” vs “ Wide angle ” view of the coding
	+ Revision – may end up dividing or combining categories
	+ May establish criteria for category coding

<div class="notes">

Phrasing of the person versus observations generated by the researcher. Labels should be considered as provisional as you work with more complete information. It is an iterative process. Go back to original data. You're looking at the specific of what's been told versus a broader understanding.

Establishing the criteria may depend on how many people are doing the coding. If you don't have a pre-existing structure, the coding may evolve and may involve 100% review (both raters review everything and resolve discrepancy). Then a third person does an audit.

</div>

***
### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Saturation – the point at which you are not gaining any new insight, no new categories being identified, no new relationships being defined
	+ Don't need any additional analysis
	+ Don't need any additional data collection (if collection & analysis done in parallel)
	+ Determinant – nature of the information being collection – NOT amount of information
	+ Keeping notes – of the coding/analysis process
	+ Help identify categories/relationships
	+ Help if "stuck"
	+ Document analysis process

<div class="notes">

Saturation is a way to assess your sample size. Have you gotten a representative amount of data. 

Really important to keep notes of the coding and analysis process, so you can check your work. Allows you to do qualirty checks on the process.

</div>

***
### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Role of Judgment
	+ Balancing act –
		+ Level of creativity by coder to identify categories/relationships
		+ Must reflect the informants thoughts
		+ Audit of the coding by an independent person can check for the match between the coding and the source information
	+ Low-inference descriptors
	+ Look for "negative cases"

<div class="notes">

You develop a framework, but that framework must always represent what the subjects have said.

Low inference descriptors are those things involving just the basic words or text.

</div>

***
### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Quantifying Information
	+ Pros & Cons
	+ When quantifying might be of value
	+ Simple frequency of occurrence does NOT necessarily reflect importance

<div class="notes">

This was mentioned earlier.

</div>

***
### Eton Article 

+ Long-term Goal – “… build a general, multi-domain, patient-reported measure of burden of treatment with wide applicability across diseases and treatments”
+ Semi-structured qualitative interviews
	+ “identify issues … illustrative of burden of treatment …”
	+ “inform derivation of a general, patient-reported measure of burden of treatment flexible enough for application across any disease or treatment regimen.”

<div class="notes">

The Eton article has a great description of the coding process. The long term goal develop a burden of treatment with wide applicability across a wide range of treatments.

Identify issues associated with burden of treatment. Derivation of patient report that is flexible enough to apply across any disease.

</div>

***
### Eton Article 

+ Development of interview
+ Content analysis process
	+ Multiple coders
	+ Identify key themes and subthemes
	+ Discussion and consensus to develop coding scheme
	+ Repeated check and update of coding process
	+ Thematic content saturation
+ Resulting major themes and subthemes

<div class="notes">

Checked for a logical flow from broad to specific. Framework from first five interviews. Reviewed after ten more interviews. Saturation reached after 25 interviews, but they had 7 more that they included anyway.

Described patient population.

Figure 1 shows the themes that emerged. 

The third theme was factors that exacebate burdens had subthemes.

</div>

***
### Berkley-Patton Article 

+ Goal – Use qualitative method to explore components of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model
	+ Information + Motivation Behavioral Skills Adherence
+ Focus Groups
+ Content analysis – “… identify themes on expectations and information, personal and social motivation, and behavioral skills related to ART adherence.”

<div class="notes">

Another example on Canvas is an article by Jannette Berkley-Patton et al. Done using focus groups and content analysis.

Information and expectations with subthemes. Specific text included as examples of themes.

</div>

***
### Berkley-Patton Article 

+ Information and expectations
+ Motivation for ART adherence
+ Behavioral skills related to ART adherence
+ Themes for each of these areas?
+ Value obtained from this kind of study?

<div class="notes">



</div>

### Nonexperimental - CBPR / PAR 

+ Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR)
+ Participatory Action Research (PAR)
	+ Takes place outside the normal research environment
	+ Designed to meet the needs of the community in which the research is conducted
	+ Value for the participants that goes beyond the value of the collected information

<div class="notes">



</div>

***
### Nonexperimental - CBPR / PAR 

+ Existing research data or data collected from other locations …
	+ May not reflect conditions (e.g., disease incidence) in the community of interest
	+ May not reflect underlying risk factors
	+ May not indicate how an intervention will work in a specific community

<div class="notes">

Community Based Participatory Research.

This is increasingly used and make a big contribution. Extent to which the population that you are interested in are very much a part of the process of designing the research. It takes place outside the research process. It hurts internal validity but it is far more relevant, improving external validity. The value goes way beyond. Develop community capacity, improves sustainability, builds skills. More emphasis on these models using PCORI. Most of this work involves the community from the beginning. 

</div>

***
### Nonexperimental - CBPR / PAR 

+ CBPR/PAR research may be more generalizable than research conducted in a clinical setting
	+ Sample characteristics
+ Practice-Based Research Networks (PBRNs)
	+ Physicians from community settings work together to study research questions of mutual interest

<div class="notes">



</div>

***
### Nonexperimental - CBPR / PAR 

+ How the research context influences the research process …
	+ What issues are routinely encountered?
	+ To whom is the research important?
	+ Ripple effect of the research process
	+ Level of engagement of the target population

<div class="notes">

Other research may not reflect what the community is interested in. Research in a carefully constrained environment may not be sustainable.

Collaboration among practitioners where they can combine efforts. Also valuable for networks of pharmacists.

Issues important to the population and community. There can be a ripple effect. When community members get engaged, they can learn skills that can help in a different context, and inform them about resources that they can use in other areas. The community gains from the whole process.

</div>

***
### Nonexperimental - CBPR / PAR 

+ Conducting CBPR/PAR
	+ Start simple
	+ Think of local comparative advantage
	+ Network
	+ Collaborate
		+ Top-down
		+ Bottom-up

<div class="notes">

Simple. What is important and what is needed. Add value to the community. Identify people who can be resources. This is very much a collaboration. It can be top-down, where you make yourself available to the community. A bottom-up is where you offer your expertise to help them develop a project.

</div>

***
### Nonexperimental - CBPR / PAR 

+ CBPR/PAR – especially appropriate for research involving health disparities
	+ Multiple individual and community-level determinants
+ Mechanism to translate basic health psychology conceptual models into interventions

<div class="notes">

There are some many community level issues associated with health disparities.

</div>

***
### Nonexperimental - CBPR / PAR 

+ Contributions by researchers
	+ Know existing research evidence
	+ Can provide support/suggestions
		+ Organization
		+ Information-gathering
		+ Action
	+ Help community get in touch with resources

<div class="notes">

You biring in your knowledge of existing resources, and provide support and suggestions. Advice about resources that they can tap.

</div>

***
### Nonexperimental - CBPR / PAR 

+ Contributions by community
	+ Unique insight into local context
	+ Information concerning local needs and priorities
	+ Provide "real world" feedback/reaction
	+ Provide guidance for adapting programs/interventions to the community
+ Community involvement community capacity sustainability

<div class="notes">

They understand needs and real world feedback. Does this fit in to individual people's needs.

</div>

***
### Assignment #4 

+ Turn in the results of a literature search on the topic you are planning to focus on for your research proposal . This is NOT expected to be a literature review; it should provide evidence that you are finding literature that is relevant to your topic. This assignment serves as the start of your References section, using the reference/citation style you plan to use in your proposal.

<div class="notes">

I don't expect this to be your final literature review but it will help form the literature review. Looking for progress in finding relevant references. No need to turn in a reference section. Use a reference or citation style. Pick a style that is used in your field. Just be consistent. Show me evidence of the literature that is relevant.
