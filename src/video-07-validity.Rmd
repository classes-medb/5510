### Validity 

![](../images/image-07-01.png)

***
### Internal Validity 

+ “The extent to which we can infer that the independent variable *caused* the dependent variable.”
	+ For non-experimental studies –
		+ How “well designed and conducted” was the study?
+ Three criteria for causality

***
### Internal Validity 

+ “The extent to which we can infer that the independent variable *caused* the dependent variable.”
+ Three criteria for causality
	+ IV *must precede* the outcome variable
	+ IV *must be related* to the outcome
	+ There must be no other variables that could explain why the IV is related to the outcome

***
### Internal Validity 

+ Three criteria for causality –
	+ IV *must precede* the outcome variable
	+ IV *must be related* to the outcome
	+ There must be no other variables that could explain why the IV is related to the outcome
+ By Research Approach –
	+ Randomized Exp
	+ Quasi- Exp
	+ Comparative
	+ Associational
	+ Descriptive

"IV must be related to the outcome","Met","Usually met","Usually met","Usually met","NA",

***
### Internal Validity 

+ Meeting the 3 causality criteria based on –
	+ Strength of the research design
	+ Internal validity

***
### Internal Validity 

+ Internal validity -
	+ Most often discussed with reference to randomized experimental and quasi-experimental designs
	+ Can also be applied to non-experimental studies

***
### Internal Validity 

+ Evaluating the internal validity of a study –
	+ Equivalence of the groups on participant characteristics
	+ Control of extraneous experiences and environmental variables

***
### Internal Validity 

+ Equivalence of the groups on participant characteristics –
	+ Are groups equivalent prior to introduction of IV?
		+ Randomized experimental design –
			+ Random assignment
		+ Quasi-experimental design –
			+ Random assignment of treatments
			+ Matching
			+ Checking pretest scores

***
### Internal Validity 

+ Equivalence of the groups on participant characteristics –
	+ Are groups equivalent prior to introduction of IV?
		+ Comparative design –
			+ Statistical adjustment (ANCOVA) to adjust DV scores to make groups more nearly equivalent
			+ Matching participants on variables other than the primary IV
				+ E.g. Case-control study
			+ Check after the study for comparability

***
### Internal Validity 

+ Equivalence of the groups on participant characteristics –
	+ Are groups equivalent prior to introduction of IV?
		+ Associational design –
			+ Only 1 group
			+ Not able to provide evidence of causation
			+ “Equivalence” – “… whether those who score high on the IV … are similar to those … who score low in terms of other attributes that may be related to the DV.”
			+ May be able to provide some statistical control

***
### Internal Validity 

+ Control of extraneous experiences and environmental variables –
	+ Extraneous variables – variables other than the IV and DV
	+ Environmental variables – conditions/variables that occur during the study
	+ Contamination
	+ Issue – Is one group affected more than the other(s)?
	+ Less of an issue with a more controlled research setting

***
### Internal Validity 

+ Rating the dimensions of internal validity
	+ Figure 8.2
	+ Evaluating Research Validity framework
	+ “Good” study – moderate to high internal validity on both dimensions

***
### Threats to Internal Validity 

![](../images/image-07-03.png)

***
### Threats to Internal Validity 

+ Equivalence of Groups
	+ Use of extreme groups
	+ Participant dropouts or attrition during the study
	+ Bias in assignment to groups

***
### Threats to Internal Validity 

+ Control of extraneous/environmental variables
	+ Changes due to time or growth and development
	+ Extraneous environmental events
	+ Repeated testing, carryover effects
	+ Instrument or observer inconsistency
	+ Combinations of two or more threats
	+ Did the IV actually occur before the DV?

***
### Threats to Internal Validity 

+ Other threats
	+ Effects of being in the control group
	+ Expectation effect
		+ Control for expectation
	+ Observer / experimenter bias

***
### Sampling 

+ “… process of selecting *part* of a larger group of participants with the intent of generalizing from the sample (the smaller group) to the population (the larger group).”
	+ “… representativeness of the sample is more important than its size …”

***
### Sampling 

+ Reasons for sampling
	+ Expense
	+ Time
	+ Quality control

***
### Sampling 

![](../images/image-07-06.png)

***
### Sampling 

+ Sampling designs – Probability sampling
	+ Simple random sampling
	+ Systematic random sampling
	+ Stratified random sampling
	+ Cluster (random) sampling

***
### Sampling 

+ Sampling designs – Nonprobability sampling
	+ Quota sampling
	+ Purposive sampling
		+ Purposeful sampling
	+ Convenience sampling

***
### Sampling 

+ Sample size
	+ General rules
		+ Representativeness vs number
		+ Impact of having very large sample sizes
	+ Generally –
		+ Need sample to be large enough so you don’t miss important findings
		+ If very large sample, need to distinguish statistical significance vs clinically important

***
### External Validity 

+ Generalizability
	+ Fig. 9.3
	+ Evaluating Research Validity Framework
	+ Two main aspects
		+ Population external validity
		+ Ecological external validity

***
### External Validity 

+ Population external validity
	+ How participants were selected for the study?
	+ Is sample representative of the target population?
	+ Validity framework

***
### External Validity 

+ Ecological external validity
	+ Whether the results can be generalized to real-life outcomes
	+ Trade-off with control of study
	+ Validity framework

### Assignment #5 

+ Prepare a first draft of the literature review that supports your research topic and provides evidence of the significance of the topic. Submit this assignment using “ Turnitin ” through Blackboard.
