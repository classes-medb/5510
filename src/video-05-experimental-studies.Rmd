### Research Approaches 

![](../images/image-05-02.png)

***
### Research Approaches 

+ Randomized Experimental
+ Criteria
	+ Random assignment
	+ Active independent variable
	+ (Experimenter control of active independent variable)
		+ What is “treatment”
		+ When it will be given
		+ Who it will be given to

***
### Research Approaches 

+ Randomized Experimental
+ Importance of random assignment
	+ Bias
	+ Equivalence of groups before treatment
+ Random selection (sampling)
	+ What does this mean?
	+ How does it relate to random assignment?
	+ Value of random selection?

***
### Research Approaches 

+ Quasi-Experimental
+ What criteria of Experimental not met?
+ Categories of Q-E approach
	+ Q-E with major limitations
	+ Pretest-Posttest designs
	+ Time-series designs
	+ Single-subject designs

### Randomized Experimental and Q-E Designs

***
### Quasi-Experimental Designs 

+ Categories of Q-E approach
	+ Q-E with major limitations
	+ Pretest-Posttest designs
	+ Time-series designs
	+ Single-subject designs

***
### Quasi-Experimental Designs 

+ Q-E with major limitations
+ Also called Pre-experimental
	+ One-Group Posttest-Only
		+ NR	E:		X	O

***
### Quasi-Experimental Designs 

+ Q-E with major limitations
+ Also called Pre-experimental
	+ One-Group Pretest-Posttest
		+ NR	E:	O1	X	O2
	+ Improvement - Wait-List Comparison Group
		+ Immediate Group	O1	X	O2
		+ Wait-List Group	O1	~X	O2	X	O3

***
### Quasi-Experimental Designs 

+ Q-E with major limitations
+ Also called Pre-experimental
	+ Posttest-Only Nonequivalent Groups
		+ NR	E:		X	O
		+ NR	C:		~X	O

***
### Quasi-Experimental Designs 

+ Better Q-E Designs
	+ Pretest-Posttest Nonequivalent Comparison Group
		+ NR	E:	O1	X	O2
		+ NR	C:	O1	~X	O2
		+ 3 strengths based on
			+ How participants got into the groups/conditions
			+ How much control investigator has over IV
		+ Strong
		+ Moderate-strength
		+ Weak

***
### Quasi-Experimental Designs 

+ Better Q-E Designs
	+ Single-Group Time-Series
		+ Characteristics
		+ Temporary treatment vs Continuous treatment
	+ Multi-Group Time-Series
		+ Characteristics
		+ Temporary treatment vs Continuous treatment

***
### Quasi-Experimental Designs 

+ Typical examples of Q-E designs
	+ Case-control study
	+ Cohort study
	+ Non-equivalent control group design
	+ Interrupted time-series design
	+ Single system design

***
### Randomized Experimental Designs 

+ Characteristics

	+ Type of IV
	+ Control of IV
+ Purpose
