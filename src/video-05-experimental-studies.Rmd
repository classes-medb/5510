### Research Approaches 

![](../images/image-05-01.png)

<div class="notes">

We are using this figure a lot because it helps us organize information. Are you trying to explore relationships or describe. Experimental designs almost always explore relationships. 

An experimental design has an active independent variable (one that is manipulated).

The split in experimental designs

### Research Approaches 

![](../images/image-05-02.png)

<div class="notes">

Figure 4.2 walks you through the major designs. Note that the random assignment of patients to groups is not the same as the random selection of groups.

In a quasi-experimental design, sometimes the active independent variable is manipulated by the investigator, sometimes not. 

</div>

***
### Research Approaches 

+ Randomized Experimental
+ Criteria
	+ Random assignment
	+ Active independent variable
	+ (Experimenter control of active independent variable)
		+ What is “treatment”
		+ When it will be given
		+ Who it will be given to

<div class="notes">

Random assignment of people into groups or conditions. Controling the type of treatment or when it is given.

Sometimes the treatment is delivered by someone other the investigator, but gives randomization information to someone else.

</div>

***
### Research Approaches 

+ Randomized Experimental
+ Importance of random assignment
	+ Bias
	+ Equivalence of groups before treatment
+ Random selection (sampling)
	+ What does this mean?
	+ How does it relate to random assignment?
	+ Value of random selection?

<div class="notes">

Random sample does not rely on any characteristics of an individual.

You can use a random number generator to assign or a random number table.

Randomization gives you the best chance of the two groups being equivalent.

Note that alternating assignment is not the same as random assignment. Does a temporal trend cause bias?

Also note that haphazard assignment is not the same as random assignment.

Alternatives to random assignment leaves you with a good chance that your study will not end up getting included in a systematic overview.

Random sampling. How do people get included in a study?

Most random assignment studies use a non random selection.

It is quite difficult to do random selection, but easy to do random assignment.

</div>

***
### Research Approaches 

+ Quasi-Experimental
+ What criteria of Experimental not met?
+ Categories of Q-E approach
	+ Q-E with major limitations
	+ Pretest-Posttest designs
	+ Time-series designs
	+ Single-subject designs

<div class="notes">

Quasi-experimental designs fail to meet the goal of randomization. It could be that we do not have control over the treatment assignment. A quasi-experimental design does not allow you to establish causality.

Single subject designs are covered separately.

</div>

<div class="notes">

Figure 4.3. The way notations are used to describe designs.

R = randomized, NR = not randomized.

E = experimental, C = control

Active vs Attribute variable.

This notation is used as we talk about different designs.

</div>

### Randomized Experimental and Q-E Designs 

![](../images/image-05-04.png)

<div class="notes">

Figure 5.1 talks about verious experimental and quasi-experimental designs. Designs increase in rigor as you go down the table. When are measurements made.

</div>

***
### Quasi-Experimental Designs 

+ Categories of Q-E approach
	+ Q-E with major limitations
	+ Pretest-Posttest designs
	+ Time-series designs
	+ Single-subject designs

<div class="notes">



</div>

***
### Quasi-Experimental Designs 

+ Q-E with major limitations
+ Also called Pre-experimental
	+ One-Group Posttest-Only
		+ NR	E:		X	O

<div class="notes">

Only one group. No randomization. Treatment given to everyone and you get a measurement only after the treatment. It could be useful for pilot studies (feasibility)

Expectancy effect.

</div>

***
### Quasi-Experimental Designs 

+ Q-E with major limitations
+ Also called Pre-experimental
	+ One-Group Pretest-Posttest
		+ NR	E:	O1	X	O2
	+ Improvement - Wait-List Comparison Group
		+ Immediate Group	O1	X	O2
		+ Wait-List Group	O1	~X	O2	X	O3

<div class="notes">

One group, pre-test versus post-test. You can look at change before and after the intervention. You still don't know if the change would have occured even without this intervention.

A wait list comparison, one group gets the treatment immediately and the second group has to wait before getting the treatment.

This is an attractive design when the clinicians want to avoid giving the placebo to anyone.

From a recruitment point of view, people who want the treatment may be willing to tolerate a delay.

Note that there are two changes (O2 minus O1) and (O3 minus O2).

</div>

***
### Quasi-Experimental Designs 

+ Q-E with major limitations
+ Also called Pre-experimental
	+ Posttest-Only Nonequivalent Groups
		+ NR	E:		X	O
		+ NR	C:		~X	O

<div class="notes">

We don't have random assignment, so you may have non-equivalent groups.

</div>

***
### Quasi-Experimental Designs 

+ Better Q-E Designs
	+ Pretest-Posttest Nonequivalent Comparison Group
		+ NR	E:	O1	X	O2
		+ NR	C:	O1	~X	O2
		+ 3 strengths based on
			+ How participants got into the groups/conditions
			+ How much control investigator has over IV
		+ Strong
		+ Moderate-strength
		+ Weak

<div class="notes">

Introducing a pre-test measurement offers a further improvement. The pre-measure allows us to test for differences before the intervention was introduced.

A stronger version of this design. Can you randomize which group gets the intervention, even if you can't randomize individuals?

If people self-select, but not on the basis of which group they get into, that strengthens the design. But you can't rule out the possibility of systematic differences that might still influence the outcome.

</div>

***
### Quasi-Experimental Designs 

+ Better Q-E Designs
	+ Single-Group Time-Series
		+ Characteristics
		+ Temporary treatment vs Continuous treatment
	+ Multi-Group Time-Series
		+ Characteristics
		+ Temporary treatment vs Continuous treatment

<div class="notes">

Multiple measures over time in your outcome variable.

### Q-E Time Series Designs 

![Portney & Watkins, 2009](../images/image-05-05.png)

<div class="notes">

With time series designs, you are frequently looking at two different kinds of signals. You get a feel for change in the trend before and after. You also have the possibility of a jump (shift) at the time of the intervenion.

Notice in this graph.

</div>

***
### Q-E Time Series Designs 

![](../images/image-05-06.png)

<div class="notes">

Figure 11.5 shows three different patterns. Four measurements before treatment and four measurements after treatment. Notice the bottom line shows an up and down pattern. If you looked only at O4 and O5, you might think, Wow! but the values at O6, O7, etc.

The middle line B shows an increasing trend but this increase appears to be unrelated to the intervention.

The top line shows a shift that is temporally associated with the intervention.

These designs show some evidence of causation without a concurrent control group.

Portney & Watkins, 2009

### Quasi-Experimental Designs 

+ Typical examples of Q-E designs
	+ Case-control study
	+ Cohort study
	+ Non-equivalent control group design
	+ Interrupted time-series design
	+ Single system design

<div class="notes">

You identify a group of cases matched with controls. These are, for the most part, retrospective comparisons.

Cohort design, you get a group of patients at risk of something and follow them over time. Cohort studies can be prospective or retrospective. 

Two or more pre-existing groups of people. You introduce an intervention to one group.

Case studies. 

Withdrawal design.

The Tucker article is a good example of a quasi-experimental design.

### Assignment #3 

+ Prepare a brief description of the topic you are planning to focus on for your research proposal. (Introduction)

<div class="notes">

A single paragraph that might serve as your introduction. There is a template available on the Canvas site. If you want to start creating your proposal using a structure, feel free to use this template.
