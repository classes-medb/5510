### Additional topics

* As another aside, I was involved with a similar study (prospective, not retrospective). We planned this study using a one-sided hypothesis (remote prayer has a positive effect on health). The Institutional Review Board suggested changing this to a two-sided hypothesis (remote prayer has either a positive or a negative effect on health). Thankfully, we did not observe an outcome in the opposite tail as that would have been very difficult to explain.

### Pilot testing

* Clarity of items
* Content
* "Whether your items cover all aspects of the domain you intend to measure and whether they are in appropriate proportions relative to that domain."

### Data Collection Techniques 

+ Process of developing a survey
	+ List of measures/variables
	+ What's already available?
	+ Put the pieces together
	+ Test and revise as needed
	+ Final check – do you really need all of the items?
+ Analysis of survey data

<div class="notes">

Flows well and is clear.

Get some real test runs with people who have seen it for the first time. Do you really need all of these items?

### Coding

* Mutually exclusive
* Multiple response
* "Other" responses
* Use number codes for categorical data
* Missing codes
  + Never use blanks for missing (book is wrong)
  + -1, 99
  + Multiple codes for multiple reasons
* Dummy coding
  + 0/1 for absence/presence
* Reverse coding
  + High is always positive
* Tabular format
  + No more than one piece of information
* Double entry coding
* Standard coding for race/ethnicity

### Variable names

* Not too short, not too long
* Word delimiters
  + No spaces, symbols
* Example for Mother's age
* Bad choices
  + mom age
  + mom-age
  + momage
* Good choices
  + mom.age
  + mom_age
  + MomAge

### Codebook

* Also known as data dictionary

### Quality checks

* Minimum and maximum checks
  + Out of range
  + Zero variation
* Missing value count
* List five five rows, last five rows
* Correlations

### Data reduction

* Create composite scores
  + Check Cronbach's alpha
  + Examine leaving out single items
* Factor analysis
  + Supplanted by Structural Equations Modeling

### Data transformations

* Ideal - selected a priori
  + Sometimes based on precedent
  + Sometimes motivated by theory
  + Sometimes based on empirical findings

### Additional topics

* Pilot studies

<div class="notes">

Table 13.1 is useful in terms of the various things that we will touch on. It classifies by the two types of quantitative research and by qualitative research. Organized by the potential amount of patient filtering. The ones at the top should have less participant filtering. Also note that the symbols are not hard and fast rules, but represent the likelihood.

### Data Collection Techniques 

+ Standardized vs Investigator-Developed Instruments
	+ Development and Use
	+ Evidence to support investigator-developed instruments

<div class="notes">

There is a lot of work in the development of standardized instruments, manual and documentaiton, normative values, apply to a broad area. Investigator developed instruments focus on a more specialized area, but you still need to supply information on validity and reliability.

Whenever possible use instruments already in use. You can find these in places like PROQOLID. This originally started as quality of life measurements, but has expanded. NIH compilation of patient reported outcome measures (PROMIS). NIH wants the research community to use common measures to allow easier compilation of studies in a meta-analysis.

</div>

***
### Data Collection Techniques 

+ Researcher-Observed Measures
	+ Naturalness of the setting
	+ Observer “participation”
	+ Amount of detail
	+ Breadth of coverage

<div class="notes">

The focus is on direct observation. The more natural the setting, the less control you have. This might hurt the internal validity of the study. It is a trade-off.

How much does the observer participate. In interviews and focus groups, there is a very clear high level of participation. On the other extreme, observation in public places might not have any knowledge of their participation. In the middle are studies where participants know they are being observed, but this knowledge may fade into the background.

</div>

***
### Data Collection Techniques 

+ Tests and Documents
	+ Standardized tests
		+ Norm referenced test
		+ Criterion referenced test
	+ Achievement tests
	+ Performance and Authentic assessments
	+ Aptitude tests
	+ Documents
	+ Content analysis

<div class="notes">

Norm scores allow you to compare to other scores (historical comparisons). These tests are very objective, but there is some subjectivity, perhaps, in their interpretation.

Measuring actual performance (ecologic validity). Tries to be very relevant to the setting.

Use existing documents. Existing records might have a higher level of accuracy but there is no gauarantee. Time is shorter because the documents already exist. Data extraction takes time. Do you need consent from the people associated with these documents.

Data abstraction is tedious, but the newer systems like i2b2 allow you to get the information more directly.

Content analysis is a more qualitative review. It gives you a lot of valuable information that a quantitative approach might miss.

</div>

***
### Data Collection Techniques 

+ Self-Report Measures
	+ Standardized Personality Inventories
	+ Attitudes / Beliefs scales
		+ Likert scale
		+ Semantic differential scale
	+ Questionnaires
		+ How delivered / administered
		+ Item types
	+ Interviews
	+ Focus groups

<div class="notes">

Personality inventories: the validity is dependent on an individual's self-awareness.

Attitudes and beliefs done for a variety of purposes. A "representative sample of all possible opinions or attitudes about a particularl subject." That's why measurement experts cringe when you ask a single question. You need a multiple set of items to get at how people feel.

The Likert scale is very popular. You may not see the semantic difference scale, but examples will follow.

Delivery by mail or Internet. There are pros and cons to all formats. Item types could include open ended, partial (responses plus other), and close ended responses.

</div>

### Descriptive Research 

+ Surveys
	+ Methods
		+ Interview
		+ Questionnaires
	+ Design of surveys
		+ Research question
		+ Review of existing instruments
		+ Process of designing survey

<div class="notes">

Interview allows you to probe for comments. Video as well as audio is now available. It takes time and training. Concerns about anonymity with an interview.

Questionnaires are self-administered. Return rates are a concern. When sent out blindly, you can get low return rates, which hurts the generalizability of the study. There is potential for misunderstanding and people may get into a routine response and not provide as good quality of response.

Design the survey to address your research question. Thing about the pieces and the order.

</div>

***
### Data Collection Techniques 

+ Surveys
	+ Survey question format –
		+ Open ended
		+ Close ended
	+ Wording of questions
	+ Scales
		+ Scale of measurement
		+ Response options

<div class="notes">

Even as simple as something like age, you can ask it in an open ended format that allows you to categorize any way you like or even to forgo categorization.

Wording is important. Simplicity and reading level. Use standardized scales whenever you can. 

Double-barreled questions. [[Ask option about supervisors and managers]]

How many times questions, think about the time frame (over the past 24 hours, past week, past month). Shorter time frames better recall, but subject to more external variations.

Building a level of trust. Don't ask people to admit to "bad behavior". Think of it from the perspective of the person providing the information.

Some debate about the number of categories. Odd versus even. Even forces an opinion. Also a debate over a large versus a small number of items.

Do you want to reverse code some items. It could help keep the participants alert and thingking  This may end up confusing. [[13 questions, but question 8, first question on the bakc page, was the only reverse coding.]]

	+ Data collection
		+ Check for completeness if possible

<div class="notes">

How things are working, where there is lack of clarity, how long does it take, where the systems don't work.

Make sure that your extraction process is complete as possible for secondary data. For prospective surveys, flip through a survey upside down to see if items are all filled in. Hope that you haven't missed a page. Electronic collection can force someone to respond before they answer the next question.

[[Ethically can't force someone to complete a questionnaire.]]

How do you handle multiple responses.

Code the maximal detail of variables like age so you can collapse as you see fit. Make sure that you code missing or ambiguous responses consistently.

REDCap is great!

Tools: semi-structured interviews, participant observation, photo elicitation(?), mapping exercises(?), web and space design workshops(?), archival records, physical artifacts, 

Typically, a one-hour interview requires a minimum of three to four hours (or more) of analysis.

Involve the participants in the process, especially for narrative research.

### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Inductive process –
	+ Start with the specific (raw data / transcript)
	+ Develop a theoretical framework from the data
	+ Conceptual categories emerge from the data

<div class="notes">



</div>


### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Start the study with a research question
	+ This may provide a potential starting point for analyzing text
	+ If you do this, DO NOT let it prevent you from seeing what is in the text
+ Steps
	+ From raw data to theory building
	+ “ Iterative ” process
		+ e.g. , as you are developing categories, check them back against the raw data – do they continue to reflect the original data?

<div class="notes">

Keep alert and look for things that come out in the material that you were not anticipating. As your categories, go back and compare them against the raw data. Make sure that you allow the data to guide you. Often coding from transcripts. But it is also good to have access to the original recordings. Sometimes there is a doubt about what some was saying (joking or sarcasm). Look for tone of voice and non-verbal cues.

Content analysis is a generic term, but you can look at things like ad messages in magazines that appeal to young adults.

Thematic analysis is looking for patterns.

</div>


### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Analysis process –
	+ Given research question, may have some idea of a general conceptual structure; serve only as a starting point
	+ Usually work from transcripts
	+ If possible, refer back to audio recordings when needed
	+ Qualitative form of analysis
		+ Content analysis – analysis of the content of communication
		+ Thematic analysis – identifying patterns or themes in the data

<div class="notes">

Break up the text into "bits" that represent specific thoughts. Open coding lots of themes. Axial coding looks at the relationships between themes, builds a superstructure of ideas.

</div>


### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Category Formation – assign sections (data bits) to analytical categories/themes "coding"
	+ Summarizing the data by identifying similarities and differences / commonalities and contrasts
	+ Categories:
		+ More manageable units of information
		+ "open coding"
		+ Descriptive – Concrete
		+ Interpretive – Abstract
		+ Relational
	+ Cross-reference categories back to text
		+ Makes it easier to revise coding as needed

<div class="notes">

Software allows you to go back and forth between themes and the original text. Cross-referencing is important. Find examples easily. It helps provide validity checks. Does someone agree with your categorization.

Categories need to be faithful to the data. This is internal validity. But you need to place this in a broader understanding.

You need to be careful about trying to quantify this too much. Keep in mind that just because someone talks about something a lot does not mean that this is the most important thing to them. The most important thing might be something that people are uncomfortable talking about.

</div>


### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Category Formation
	+ Faithful to the data – "internal" aspect
	+ Meaningful to other categories – "external" aspect
	+ Balance
		+ Generality vs Specificity
		+ Inclusivity vs Exclusivity
	+ Number of times idea mentioned does NOT necessarily reflect importance

<div class="notes">



</div>


### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Labeling / Revising Categories
	+ Member-generated – “ first-order ” account
	+ Observer-generated – “ second-order ” account
	+ Labels are provisional; may be revised
	+ Iteration – move back and forth between raw data and labeled categories
	+ “ Zoom in ” vs “ Wide angle ” view of the coding
	+ Revision – may end up dividing or combining categories
	+ May establish criteria for category coding

<div class="notes">

Phrasing of the person versus observations generated by the researcher. Labels should be considered as provisional as you work with more complete information. It is an iterative process. Go back to original data. You're looking at the specific of what's been told versus a broader understanding.

Establishing the criteria may depend on how many people are doing the coding. If you don't have a pre-existing structure, the coding may evolve and may involve 100% review (both raters review everything and resolve discrepancy). Then a third person does an audit.

</div>


### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Saturation – the point at which you are not gaining any new insight, no new categories being identified, no new relationships being defined
	+ Don't need any additional analysis
	+ Don't need any additional data collection (if collection & analysis done in parallel)
	+ Determinant – nature of the information being collection – NOT amount of information
	+ Keeping notes – of the coding/analysis process
	+ Help identify categories/relationships
	+ Help if "stuck"
	+ Document analysis process

<div class="notes">

Saturation is a way to assess your sample size. Have you gotten a representative amount of data. 

Really important to keep notes of the coding and analysis process, so you can check your work. Allows you to do qualirty checks on the process.

</div>


### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Role of Judgment
	+ Balancing act –
		+ Level of creativity by coder to identify categories/relationships
		+ Must reflect the informants thoughts
		+ Audit of the coding by an independent person can check for the match between the coding and the source information
	+ Low-inference descriptors
	+ Look for "negative cases"

<div class="notes">

You develop a framework, but that framework must always represent what the subjects have said.

Low inference descriptors are those things involving just the basic words or text.

</div>


### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Quantifying Information
	+ Pros & Cons
	+ When quantifying might be of value
	+ Simple frequency of occurrence does NOT necessarily reflect importance

<div class="notes">

The standard deviation is considered a poor measure of variability for a non-normal population. The interquartile is the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. Define the 25th percentile as the value so that approximately 25% of the values are smaller and 75% are larger.

### Descriptive Statistics 

+ Properties of the normal curve

<div class="notes">

This is not a Statistics class, but is intended to help you decide how to choose analyses for your research plan.

There are five properties. Unimodal, symmetric (no skewness), infinite range, peakedness or flatness tells you information about the tendency to produce outliers.

### Making Inferences - NHST 

+ Populations versus Samples
+ Use inferential statistics
	+ Sample statistics (M, SD) <U+F0E8>
	+ Population parameters (mu, sigma)
+ Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)
	+ Null hypothesis (H 0 )
	+ Alternative hypothesis (H 1 )
		+ AKA research hypothesis
		+ Directional
		+ Non-directional

<div class="notes">

We are talking about data analysis and interpretation. Planning. Some of this will be familiar to you. This is not a full statistical coverage of the topic.

Take the data from the sample and make inferences about the population. The sample is a subset. Inferential statistics is the process by which you infer information about the population.

NHST is the traditional way that a huge amount of research relies on.

Null hypothesis is no difference or no relationship. The alternative is often called the research hypothesis.

</div>

+ NHST – Goal of research –
	+ Reject the H 0 in favor of H 1

Does the data allow us to reject the null hypothesis. Rejecting means the difference or relationship is greater than what you'd expect due to sampling error.

never talk about proving the null hypothesis. A large p-value does not mean that you proved the null hypothesis. There might be sources of error that lead to failure to reject the null hypothesis.

<div class="notes">

Directional is more likely when comparing a treatment to a control [[placebo]]. When comparing two different treatments, you would have to use a non-directional hypothesis.

Is there existing evidence to support a directional hypothesis.

If you use a directional hypothesis, and you get an extreme result in the opposite direction, you can't claim statistical significance.

### Internal Validity 

+ Evaluating the internal validity of a study –
	+ Equivalence of the groups on participant characteristics
	+ Control of extraneous experiences and environmental variables

<div class="notes">

There are two aspects of internal validity, equivalence and control.

</div>

***
### Internal Validity 

+ Equivalence of the groups on participant characteristics –
	+ Are groups equivalent prior to introduction of IV?
		+ Randomized experimental design –
			+ Random assignment
		+ Quasi-experimental design –
			+ Random assignment of treatments
			+ Matching
			+ Checking pretest scores

<div class="notes">

Random assignment assures equivalence of the two groups on average. A rule of thumb is 30 people assigned to each group should give you confidence that random assignment will assure equivalence. If you are using random assignment, you should not need to test for baseline equivalence. We feel that random assignment is the best way to achieve equivalence.

In quasi-experimental design, you don't have random assignment, but you can randomly assign between the two groups. You can also use matching to achieve equivalence. Finally, you can check baseline scores for equivalence.

</div>

***
### Internal Validity 

+ Equivalence of the groups on participant characteristics –
	+ Are groups equivalent prior to introduction of IV?
		+ Comparative design –
			+ Statistical adjustment (ANCOVA) to adjust DV scores to make groups more nearly equivalent
			+ Matching participants on variables other than the primary IV
				+ E.g. Case-control study
			+ Check after the study for comparability

<div class="notes">

Since non-randomized trials have an attribute variable, you need to rely on statistical adjustment or matching. You can also check after the study for comparability.

</div>

***
### Internal Validity 

+ Equivalence of the groups on participant characteristics –
	+ Are groups equivalent prior to introduction of IV?
		+ Associational design –
			+ Only 1 group
			+ Not able to provide evidence of causation
			+ “Equivalence” – “… whether those who score high on the IV … are similar to those … who score low in terms of other attributes that may be related to the DV.”
			+ May be able to provide some statistical control

<div class="notes">

Equivalence when you have a continuous independent variable means that those who score high on the variable are similar to those who score low.

</div>

***
### Internal Validity 

+ Control of extraneous experiences and environmental variables –
	+ Extraneous variables – variables other than the IV and DV
	+ Environmental variables – conditions/variables that occur during the study
	+ Contamination
	+ Issue – Is one group affected more than the other(s)?
	+ Less of an issue with a more controlled research setting

<div class="notes">

Your study could be contaminated by other variables. These variables might be out of your control but which can influence the outcome.

Contamination: people in the intervention group are friends with the control group and share information.

The key issue is whether one group is more affected by extraneous variables.

In a controlled setting, there are fewer extraneous variables, but this changes in a field setting.

Table 8.1 relates statistical terminology to identify threats to internal validity. This table tries to take those technical terms and express them 

Extreme groups have issues with regression to the mean. Even without any intervention, the extremities will tend to lessen.

Dropouts or attrition means that you've designed a setting that is so difficult that no one can stay in. Differential attrition is especially troublesome.

Bias in assignment occurs when patients or their physicians directly or indirectly influence the assignment. Random assignment eliminates this bias.

<div class="notes">

Here are some of the sources of extraneous variables. 

Maturation.

History. Something that occurs between the pre and post measurements that is independent of the intervention but which can influence the outcome.

Worry about sensitization to the issue in the baseline measurement that causes people to go out and find more.

Long studies have problems with instrumentation or observers (e.g., because of turnover).

There are also combinations of these events where one magnifies the other.

Temporal order of the variables. If you can't assure that the independent variable occurs before the dependent variable, you can't establish causation.

### Measurement 

+ What do we mean “ measurement ” ?
	+ assignment of numbers or symbols to the different levels or values of variables according to rules. ” 

<div class="notes">

We are talking about measurement this week. You are either taking stats or have taken it in the past. This is not a statistics class. Think about what type of variables you will collect and propose what statistical analysis.

Your book defines it as the assignment of numbers or symbols. Notice that this takes a quantitative approach. But even in a qualitative study, you still going to want to summarize information like demographics of your sample. Describe the quality or quantity of a variable.

There are qualitative or quantitative ways to measure things like pain.

We can also use measurements to make absolute decisions. Establish a cut-point. 

Conditions, distinctions.

</div>

***
### Measurement 

+ Assigning a number to represent …
	+ Continuous value
	+ Discrete value
+ Precision of measurement
	+ Continuous variable …
	+ Discrete variable …

<div class="notes">

Value that is assigned can take on any value. Preciseness is dependent on the device used to collect the measurement. It could be the precision of a laser versus a cruder measure. Precision should be appropriate to what you are trying to get at. Lack precision does not mean that your results are not continuous. If you round to the nearest inch, you still are measuring an underlying construct that can take on more precision. Example is blood pressure, interbeat interval, where rounding is done but it still represents a continuous variable.

Discrete values because of rounding, using counts, or a limited number of categories. As long as it represents an underlying construct, consider it as continuous.

<div class="notes">

A survey or scale to get at depression, pain, those kind of things. These are abstract variables.

Bottom line is to define and operationalize how you measure something. It's easy to say something like quality of life but you have to pin this down and establish measurement validity. Consistency is important to avoid measurement bias.

Even for pretty obvious values like blood pressure, there are different ways to measure and you need to choose a single method for consistency and careful control, and when there are multiple methods, chose the method that is optimal for your needs. Blood pressure, for example, can be influenced by whether you are sitting or standing and whether you are talking while the measurement is being done.

Formalizing the rules for measurement helps reduce bias. This is a real concern when you have a variety of people doing the same measurements. How are new hires trained? Can you verify that they are trained to the standard that you have promised.

### Measurement 

+ Traditional levels (scales) of measurement
	+ Nominal
	+ Ordinal
	+ Interval
	+ Ratio

<div class="notes">

Nominal means names, classification, or categorical assignment. Names are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Value that is shown is a number code or a text word. 

Ordinal is similar to nominal plus some orderliness as to what those responses mean. Example five point scale.

There is no true zero point. Can't perform arithmetic operatitons on ordinal variables.

You can talk about the direction of change.

Interval - difference between levels is consistent across the range of the scale.

Ratio. There is a true zero point.

</div>

### Measurement 

+ Authors categorization of levels of measurement
	+ Nominal
	+ Dichotomous
	+ Ordinal
	+ Normally distributed
+ Table 10.1

<div class="notes">

Gliner et al have a slightly different take. They talk about a normally distributed scale. It is hard to talk about the difference between ordinal and interval. 

Look at the literature in the area you work with. Several Likert scales summed to get a subscale.

### Measurement 

![](../images/image-08-01.png)

<div class="notes">

Table 10.1. This scale splits nominal into those with two levels (dichotomous, also known as binary) and more than two levels (nominal).

Remember how you coded nominal variables. You can (and should) use zero-one coding for dichotomous variables.

The average of a zero-one coded variable represents a probability.

Approximately normal scale requires at least five levels accorind to Gliner et al.

### Measurement 

+ Why does the scale of measurement matter?
	+ How it reflects your design and your research question
	+ How it determines the types of statistical analyses you will do
	+ How it defines what you can say about your results

<div class="notes">

The level of measurement comes from what you are trying to get at in your research.

Measurement scales can limit what you can say about your results.

</div>

### Assignment #6 

+ Prepare a brief paragraph that describes the research design you are using for your research proposal. This is the information that will probably appear in the Methods section of your proposal.

<div class="notes">

Go back are refer to Figure 4.1. Week 8 activities relate to the exemplar articles. These are on the Canvas site. There are six included. Pick one and get familiar with it.

### External Validity 

+ Generalizability
	+ Fig. 9.3
	+ Evaluating Research Validity Framework
	+ Two main aspects
		+ Population external validity
		+ Ecological external validity

<div class="notes">

The extent to which results can be generalized beyond this study. Extrapolate to the bigger world.

Evaluating freamework (questions 14 and 15). 

Population: how participants were selected.

Ecologic validity: the more control you have, the better the internal validity but the less like it is for real world. The naturalness of the setting, rapport.

### Measurement Validity 

+ Internal structure evidence –
	+ “Evidence from several types of analysis, including factor analysis and differential item functioning …”
	+ Does an analysis of the internal structure of a measure match the conceptual framework?

<div class="notes">

Factor analysis is a method of grouping items representative of individual constructs.

In the week 9 folder is the MOTIV* document. The CES-D score has twenty items rated on a 0 to 4 scale, with four of the items reverse scaled. 

There is a somatic factor in this scale. This might be considered a subscale. Run a factor analysis, even though it only has four levels. Do the items all hang together.

### Measurement Validity 

+ Factor analysis – Beliefs about ART measure
+ The following questions involve your personal views about the HIV medications that have been prescribed for you.  Please indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with the following statements.
+ Response scale: 1 (strongly disagree), 2 (disagree), 3 (uncertain), 4 (agree), 5 (strongly agree)

```{r tbl34, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
tbl34 <- tibble::tribble(
~``,
"(C) b. Having to take medicines worries me",
"(N) c. My life would be impossible without my medicines",
"(N) d. Without my medicines I would be very ill",
"(C) e. I sometimes worry about long-term effects of my medicines",
"(C) f. My medicines are a mystery to me",
"(N) g. My health in the future will depend on my medicines",
"(C) h. My medicines disrupt my life",
"(C) i.  I sometimes worry about becoming too dependent on my medicines",
"(N) j.  My medicines protect me from becoming worse"

<div class="notes">

The ones in yellow. Multiple items to represent a measure. Is there variability in any of those items. If you had selected one and only one item, it might be influenced by external factors like your mood. Multiple items avoid this problem.

The N items had Cronbach's alpha of ?? and the C items had Cronbach's alpha of ??.

A factor analysis allows us to see if the measure is behaving the way we expect it to.
