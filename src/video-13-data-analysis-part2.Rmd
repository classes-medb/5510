### Data Analysis 

+ Project design and planning
	+ Determine research hypotheses / questions
	+ Study design
	+ Measures – IV and DV
	+ Test research hypotheses / questions

<div class="notes">



</div>

***
### Data Analysis 

+ Design Classification –
	+ Between-Groups Designs
		+ Each person “… is in *one and only one* condition or group.”
	+ Within-Subjects (Repeated Measures) Designs
		+ Each person “… *receives or experiences all of the conditions* or levels of the independent variable …”
	+ Reason to use and not use Within-Subjects design?

<div class="notes">



</div>

<div class="notes">



</div>

***
### Data Analysis 

+ Labeling / Terminology
	+ Mixed Designs
		+ Have at least 1 between-groups IV and at least 1 within-subjects IV
		+ Traditionally, list between-groups IV(s) before within-subjects IV(s)
		+ Ex. 2 x 3 x 4 factorial design with repeated measures on the 3 rd factor

			+ ###of data points needed from each individual ?

***
### Statistical Analysis Selection 

+ What are your research hypotheses / questions?
	+ Difference?
		+ Experimental, Quasi-experimental, or Comparative
		+ Difference inferential statistics
	+ Association?
		+ Association (relation) between 2 or more variables
		+ Associational inferential statistics
	+ Descriptive?

<div class="notes">



</div>

***
### Statistical Analysis Selection 

+ Selecting statistical analysis method
	+ Number of IVs
		+ One IV or >1 IV?
	+ Levels within the IVs
		+ IV has few levels (2 – 4) – difference question
		+ > 4 nominal levels – usually a difference question
		+ > 4 ordinal levels – associational question
	+ Measurement scale of the DV
		+ Level of measurement

<div class="notes">

***
### Statistical Analysis Selection 

+ Selecting statistical analysis method
	+ Design classifications –
		+ Single-factor design
			+ Between-Groups vs Within-Subjects
		+ Factorial design (2 or more IVs)
			+ Between-Groups vs Within-Subjects vs Mixed

<div class="notes">



</div>

***
### Statistical Analysis Selection 

+ Level of measurement
	+ Normal
		+ Highest level of measurement
		+ Parametric statistics assume normal distribution
	+ Ordinal
		+ 3 or more ordered levels
		+ No assumption of normal distribution
	+ Nominal
		+ 3 or more unordered levels
	+ Dichotomous
		+ Special case
		+ Nominal, but can be used as if normally distributed

<div class="notes">



</div>

***
### Statistical Analysis Selection 

+ Level of measurement
	+ Difference inferential statistical analysis
		+ Level of measure for DV matters
	+ Associational inferential statistical analysis
		+ Need to consider level of measurement for all variables

<div class="notes">



</div>

***
### Statistical Analysis Selection 

+ Parametric statistics – assumptions
	+ DV values come from a population of values that is normally distributed (normality)
	+ Variances of the groups are equal (homogeneity of variance)
		+ Unequal group sizes and unequal variances <U+F0E8> increased Type I errors
	+ All participants with a particular group must be independent of each other (independence)
		+ Also an assumption for nonparametric statistics

### Statistical Analysis Selection 

+ Parametric vs Nonparametric statistics

***
### Statistical Analysis Selection 

+ Selecting statistical analysis method –
	+ RH/RQ – difference or association?
		+ If IV has 2 – 4 levels – recommend difference approach
		+ If IV has 5 or more ordered levels – recommend associational approach
		+ If IV has 5 or more nominal (unordered) levels – usually difference approach
	+ How many IVs?

	+ Description of sample
	+ Test of hypotheses/research questions
	+ Additional exploratory analyses

<div class="notes">



</div>

***
### Data Analysis 

+ Quality check of data
	+ Completeness of data collection
	+ Review for responses that are ambiguous, out of range, etc
	+ “ Edit ” responses as needed
	+ Check response frequencies

### Assignment #10 

+ Expand the “outline” for your research proposal to include information on the data analysis that will be needed for your proposed study. In addition to a description of the steps that are planned for preliminary data review (e.g., check distribution of measures, check item reliability of scales), the outline should consist of a description of analyses that are planned to address each research hypothesis/question.
