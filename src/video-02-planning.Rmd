***
### Planning a Research Project 

+ Step 1 ? Identify a research problem
+ What is a research problem?
+ Sources of research problems ?
	+ Existing research literature
	+ Theory
	+ Personal experience
	+ Clinical observation


***
### Planning a Research Project 

+ Characteristics of a good research problem?
	+ Broad vs Narrow
	+ Widespread vs Limited interest
	+ Well-researched vs Unknown territory


***
### Planning a Research Project 

+ Considerations in Choosing a Topic
	+ Interest and enthusiasm
	+ Time
	+ Cost
	+ Scope of the problem
	+ Contribution to the profession
	+ Support and expertise
	+ Access issues/human subjects
	+ Degree of control
	+ Design considerations
	+ Values and comfort level of the researcher

***
### Planning a Research Project 

+ What should NOT drive picking a research question
	+ A specific research methodology
	+ A specific funding opportunity
	+ A publication-focused motivation

***
### Planning a Research Project 

+ Importance and feasibility of the research question
	+ ?So What? test
	+ Is the question answerable?
	+ Is it feasible?

***
### Planning a Research Project 

+ Characteristics of a good research project
+ FINER
	+ Feasible

### Planning a Research Project 

+ Step 2 ? Conduct literature review
+ Purposes of literature review
+ What a literature review is NOT ?
+ What a literature review is ?
+ Sources to be used in literature review

***
### Planning a Research Project 

+ Reviewing the literature
	+ What is known
	+ What questions remain
	+ Evaluating research reports
		+ Journal quality
		+ What is the study about?
		+ Are the results of the study valid?
		+ Are the results meaningful?
		+ What does it all mean and how does it contribute to what you want to do?

***
### Research Project ? Key Concepts 

+ Variables
	+ Independent variables
		+ Active or Manipulated
		+ Attribute or Measured
	+ Dependent variables
	+ Extraneous variables

***
### Research Project ? Key Concepts 

+ Research Hypotheses vs Research Questions
	+ Difference
	+ Associational
	+ Descriptive
+ Analyses associated with each type of RH/RQ

### Research Ethics 

+ Other research ethics issues
	+ Scientific misconduct
	+ Conflict of interest
	+ Reporting research results
		+ Plagiarism
		+ Duplication

		+ Authorship
	+ Use of animals in research

***
### Research Ethics 

+ NIH definition (NIH Catalyst, 2001)
+ Scientific/research misconduct is ?
	+ Fabrication ? inventing data or results
	+ Falsification ? manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results
	+ Plagiarism ? appropriation of ideas, processes, results, or words of another person without giving appropriate credit

***
### Research Ethics 

+ Training ?
	+ CITI training ? used by multiple institutions
+ IRBs ?
	+ UMKC IRB
	+ IRBs at other institutions (CMH, St. Luke?s ?)
+ Research committees ?

***
